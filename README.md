**Vetrix** is an advanced autonomous Web3 assistant built as a Final Year Project constraint. Unlike standard dApps where users must manually click through MetaMask popups to sign transactions, **Vetrix handles execution entirely on the server via a dedicated "burner wallet"**.

You just type naturally. Vetrix understands your intent, requests missing details, verifies balances, and autonomously executes blockchain transactions on your behalf.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Context Intelligence Layer:** Vetrix converts human-native names (e.g., "John") and fiat-native values (e.g., "$10 worth") into precise blockchain parameters via a local persistent identity store and **CoinGecko** price feeds.
- 🔄 **Transaction Context Recall:** Remembers your history. "Send the same as last time" autonomously pre-fills recipients and amounts from the audit log.
- 📇 **Persistent Contact Book:** Zero-Setup local database managing custom name-to-address mappings for a friction-less experience.
- 🤖 **Neural Processing UI:** Features a high-fidelity interaction layer with real-time feedback, processing transaction intents with zero-latency visual confirmation.
- 🛡️ **Autonomous Shield Guard:** A deterministic multi-factor controller that enforces `min(0.1 ETH, 80% balance)` safety thresholds and protects gas reserves.
- 📜 **Verifiable Execution Model:** Maps natural language intent directly to on-chain `txHash` in a persistent audit trail.

## 🏗️ Version 2 Architecture Transition

In V1 (Non-Custodial), the bot was simply an intent parser that prepared transaction payloads for the user to manually sign in their browser extension. 

In **V2 (Vetrix Agent)**, the architecture shifts execution logic to the backend:
1. **Natural Input:** User types "Send 0.05 Sepolia ETH to Vitalik."
2. **Neural Parsing:** Gemini 2.0 extracts parameters and Zod validates the schema.
3. **Shield Verification:** Vetrix verifies balances and gas thresholds via the Guardrail engine.
4. **Execution:** The backend signs the transaction with the `BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` and broadcasts via Alchemy.
5. **Real-time Pulse:** The user receives a clickable Etherscan hash and a "pulsing shield" UI status while the block confirms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and an Alchemy API Key.

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

You must create two `.env` files. 

**Backend (`backend/.env`):**
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
PORT=3001
ALCHEMY_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY
BOT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_burner_wallet_private_key
```
> **Note:** The `BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` must have real Sepolia ETH to pay for transaction gas! Use a free Sepolia Faucet to fund it.

**Frontend (`frontend/.env`):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/chat
```

### 2. Installation & Running

Open two separate terminals:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with Vetrix!

## ⚠️ Technical Limitations & Academic Notice

**IMPORTANT:** This system is a **Research-Grade Autonomous Prototype** developed as part of a Final Year Project for Rathinam College of Arts and Science | Bharathiar University. 

### Core Limitations
- **Burner Wallet Risk:** The system uses a "Burner Wallet" pattern. The private key resides on the backend server. **Do NOT use with significant real assets.**
- **Centralized Dependencies:** Real-time information relies on external APIs (Gemini, CoinGecko, Alchemy). Failure of these services will degrade system functionality.
- **Single-User Architecture:** This prototype currently lacks a robust multi-user authentication layer.
- **Asynchronous Confirmation:** Transaction confirmation is handled asynchronously; real-time block-status polling is out of scope for this version.

### Future Work
- Implementation of MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for secure key management.
- Integration of local Lightweight LLMs to remove external API dependency.
- On-chain intent verification via smart contract event logs.
