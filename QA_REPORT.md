## 2. Test Execution Log

### 🧪 Test A: The "Trust Layer" Confirmation
- **Action:** Send 0.001 ETH to 0x5D...
- **Result:** Bot generated a markdown summary showing amount in **$USD**, **Gas**, and **Irreversibility Notice**.
- **Edge Case:** Replying with "No" successfully cleared the `sessionStore`.
- **Verdict:** ✅ PASS (Solves "Fear" pain point).

### 🧪 Test B: Error Forgiveness (Unknown Contact)
- **Action:** "Send 0.001 ETH to Rahul" (Not in DB).
- **Result:** Bot responded: "🔍 I don't know Rahul yet. Would you like to add them?"
- **Continuity:** Providing the address next perfectly saved the contact and proceeded to step A.
- **Verdict:** ✅ PASS (Solves "Cognitive Overload").

### 🧪 Test C: Intelligence Logic (Pre-flight Data)
- **Action:** Requested "Send half of my ETH".
- **Result:** Correctly triggered `needs_balance` state and asked for confirmation.
- **Verdict:** ✅ PASS.

### 🧪 Test D: The "Gibberish" Stress Test
- **Action:** Inputted "aksjdfh kalsjdhf klajsdhf".
- **Result:** System gracefully defaulted to the "Unknown Intent" handler instead of crashing.
- **Verdict:** ✅ PASS.

## 3. Discovered Observations (Minor Improvements)
1. **CoinGecko Latency:** In one test, the price fetch took >2s. The "Neural Loading" state successfully hid this delay from the user, but we should ensure the timeout doesn't hang the loop. (Fixed via axios timeout).
2. **Mobile Layout:** The new "Confirm/Cancel" buttons are wide. (Fixed via CSS flex-wrap).

## 4. Final Recommendation for Viva
Aura V2.3 is **stable, safe, and user-centric**. The implementation of the **Pre-flight Summary** is your strongest talking point for "AI Ethics" and "Safety-First Web3."
